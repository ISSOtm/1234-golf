The program uses only a subset of JavaScript, where only the following characters are allowed:
`!+[]()`
This has been proved to be sufficient to reproduce the whole language -- see https://jsfuck.com for details.

The program does not perform `console.log`, only returns the string. (Actually performing `console.log` would add a lot of bloat.)
